Below is a tentative outline for the InCollege program. For now, it will only consist of two directories, though this will be subject to change as the project progresses:

data/   # I/O files
    InCollege-Input.txt             # Sample input file
    InCollege-Test.txt              # Test input file
    InCollege-Output-Sample.txt     # Sample output file showing expected output
    InCollege-Output.txt            # Temporary file containing actual program output, produced during runtime

src/    # Modularized source code
    InCollege.cob                   # Main program that contains core logic
    ...                             # Various other subprograms called during main loop

Compilation:
[TBD]

Preparation of Input File `InCollege-Input.txt`:
